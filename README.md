# blender-addons-netrender
this clone original blender netrender with

* fixed bug: slave still  render image when on master has been canceled.
* Added ability to select the output file format (default all rendered images are saved in OpenEXR format)
 

There are bugs in client.py!!! but to me it is not critical
